A blockchain app (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain which saves hashes of online news articles to act like a permanent immutable online record of news article publications.

This app can be used to verify the integrity of online news sources by checking if any of their articles have been deleted or edited. The integrity of this app does not rely on trusting any independent authority as it uses publicly available immutable blockchain entries to store article data. This app can also be used to verify the entries of online archives like Wayback Machine, etc.

This app has the same vulnerabilities as every other app running on blockchain technology, the biggest of which is a 51% attack, in which colluding parties take control of a majority of the stake of the cryptocurrency and can manipulate the blockchain to their advantage. While the size of the ethereum network and its Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus network make this incredibly expensive, it is nonetheless a considerable threat to the decentralization of blockchain technology.
